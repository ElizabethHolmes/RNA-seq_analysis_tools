# RNA-seq_differential_analysis_tools
## About
RNA-seq_differential_analysis tools is a package of Python scripts designed to analyse differential expression and splicing between samples using RNA-seq data. It works on the output of the Tuxedo suite of tools for RNA-seq analysis [(Trapnell *et al.*, 2012)](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n3/full/nprot.2012.016.html) to identify genes, transcripts, or introns in spliceforms that are expressed above a user-specified threshold in one or more user-specified samples and at or below a user-specified threshold in one or more other user-specified samples.

** PLEASE NOTE: The scripts in RNA-seq_differential_analysis tools are some of my first scripts written as a beginner programmer and so I apologise if the code is inelegant, unconventional or otherwise sub-optimal; they work for the intended purpose and I provide them in case they might be useful to others, but with no guarantees. **

## Requirements
All the scripts in RNA-seq_differential_analysis tools require Python. They have been tested only with Python 2.7.3.
